# pairs_trade

This project builds the infrastructure for devising and optimizing for a pairs trading strategy (pairs_trade_test.py) based on OHLC price data retrieved from Yahoo Finance (yfinance_data.py).
After building the infrastructure, gld_gdx_pairs.ipynb explores the validity of a **GLD**/**GDX** pairs trading strategy, a strategy that attempts to exploit the relationship between the price of gold and companies in the gold mining industry.
